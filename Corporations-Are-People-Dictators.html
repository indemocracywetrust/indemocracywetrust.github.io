            <p>If you were to ask "What does Islam teach?" to a Muslim and a Christian, you would get two entirely different answers. 
              The same goes for socialism.</p>
            
            <p>Many believe it's a liberal idea where the governement spends more on services for the people. 
            But if you actually talked with a socialist, you would hear more about the work-place (the relationship between the worker and capitalists) and less about government spending. </p>
            
            <p>Socialists describe the work-place as a microcosm of an authoritarian state. Everything you do at work is owned by the company. 
            Only a portion of the value you produce is paid back to you. If there is a surplus, then that money goes to the owners or other shareholders. </p>
            <p>There is no democracy in the work-place.</p>
            
            <p>You have no vote in how that surplus is used. And quite often, corporation will donate 
            that surplus profit to politicians or other various organizations and causes. And this is why I believe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">Citizens United</a> decision 
            is so nefarious. If Corporate profit is unpaid labor, then Corporate political donations is your money given away without your say.</p>

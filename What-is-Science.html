              Did science once believe the earth is flat? How can we trust scientists about climate change?
            </p>
            <p>
              At the core of science is simply the process of independently verifying that an observed phenomena is happening for the claimed reasons.
              Independently verifying that something is true is so important - especially when it comes to the news and the internet.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              When the ancient philosphers believed that the sun revolved around the earth, were they being scientific? 
              In a way, yes - the observed phenomena (sun travelling across the sky) appeared to support the claim that the 
              sun went around the earth in space.
              But they were so wrong. So how can we trust scientists? Scientists eventually admitted that 
              reality was very much different - the earth revolved around the sun. One reason why this change happened was because 
              of the improvements in technology and the instruments that scientists used to make their measurements.
            </p>
            <p>
              New technology had a very important role in the way scientists could independently verify observations. In the 1500s, 
              Tycho Brahe use new instruments to make and record very precise measurements.
              Later in the 1600s, Copernicus and Johannes Kepler used Brahe's measurements to develop mathematical models of a 
              "Heliocentric" system that showed that the planets moved elliptically around the sun. 
              Later, Galileo confirmed those models with supporting observations by using a new piece of technology - the telescope. 
              Today, we can simply strap a GoPro to a rocket and see the truth for ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, scientists have access to a plethora of tools which are much more sophisticated, precise, and accurate. 
              Climate scientists use satellites, 
              accelerator mass spectrometers (carbon dating), 
              drills (ice core samples), and much more. To compare scientific consensus of today to that of thousands of years ago is simply 
              a bad comparison. The technology and methods scientists use today is far and away more advanced than anything we've ever had  
              in the entire history of humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
              My point is this - it's not fair to use historical consensus to cast doubt on modern consensus. You cannot 
              compare the two when the methods and technology have vastly improved over the last thousands of years let 
              alone the last few decades. However, we cannot trust a claim on consensus alone. And that is why we must 
              invest the time and money into more research about the climate (not less) as it is such an important topic that affects 
              every living thing on the planet today.

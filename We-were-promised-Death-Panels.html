              The Fabricated Controversy:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Former lieutenant governor of New York, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_McCaughey">Betsy McCaughey</a>, claimed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Obamacare</a> would enable "a vicious assault on elderly people" because it would "absolutely require" Medicare patients to have counseling sessions every five years that would "tell them how to end their life sooner". See: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/lt-gov-betsy-mccaughey-leads-death-panel-charge-writing-talking-points-article-1.395400">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/lt-gov-betsy-mccaughey-leads-death-panel-charge-writing-talking-points-article-1.395400</a></li>
                <li>Conservative talk radio hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham repeated McCaughey's claim. See: <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/05/health-care_reform">http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/05/health-care_reform</a></li>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARP">AARP</a> responded that the sessions were in no way designed to encourage euthanasia, but would instead help seniors make better decisions and would help ensure that their wishes were followed. See: <a href="https://community.aarp.org/t5/Politics-Current-Events/Health-Care-Reform-The-Assault-on-Truth-from-AARP-Bulletin-Today/td-p/1098457">https://community.aarp.org/t5/Politics-Current-Events/Health-Care-Reform-The-Assault-on-Truth-from-AARP-Bulletin-Today/td-p/1098457</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com">PolitiFact.com</a> said the proposal provided Medicare coverage for optional counseling sessions for patients who wanted to learn more about end-of-life-planning. See: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/betsy-mccaughey/mccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi/</li>
                <li>Betsy McCaughey then published an Op-Ed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post">New York Post</a>, titled "Deadly Doctors", and asserted that presidential advisor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Emanuel">Ezekiel Emanuel</a> believed (by quoting him out of context) the disabled should not be entitled to medical care. See: <a href="http://nypost.com/2009/07/24/deadly-doctors/">http://nypost.com/2009/07/24/deadly-doctors</a></li>
                <li>Excerpts from the McCaughey's op-ed were read, with approval, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Bachmann">Michele Bachmann</a> on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. See: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health/policy/25zeke.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health/policy/25zeke.html</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boehner">John Boehner</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_McCotter">Thaddeus McCotter</a> also repeated claims that Section 1233 would encourage "government-sponsored" euthanasia. See: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/us/politics/26death.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/us/politics/26death.html</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Foxx">Virginia Foxx</a> charged that the proposal would "put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government." See: <a href="http://newsok.com/democrats-take-sterner-line-against-health-care-misinformation/article/feed/66100">http://newsok.com/democrats-take-sterner-line-against-health-care-misinformation/article/feed/66100</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> also declared that the House bill had "a bias toward euthanasia". See: <a href="http://views.washingtonpost.com/healthcarerx/panelists/2009/07/right-gingrich.html">http://views.washingtonpost.com/healthcarerx/panelists/2009/07/right-gingrich.html</a></li>
                <li>The Washington Post reported that the claim had been spreading via "religious e-mail lists" and internet blogs. See: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/31/AR2009073103148.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/31/AR2009073103148.html</a></li>
                <li>In August 2009, members of Congress held town hall meetings that were marked by hostilityâ€”including shouting, sporadic, physical altercations and comparisons between the proposed reforms and Nazi Germany. See: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/politics/08townhall.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/politics/08townhall.html</a></li> 
                <li>Sarah Palin was the first to use the "death panel" term on August 7, 2009. She said: 
                  <ul><li><p><i>
                    Government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. 
                    And who will suffer the most when they ration care? 
                    The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. 
                    The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's "death panel" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their "level of productivity in society," whether they are worthy of health care. 
                    Such a system is downright evil.</i></p></li></ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            
            <h4>Now for some facts:</h4>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Legislation that provided counseling for patients on advance directives, living wills, and end-of-life care had already been on the books. However, the laws did not provide for physicians to be reimbursed for giving such counseling during routine physical exams of the elderly. Section 1233 intended to address that.</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The Patient Self-Determination Act (1991) requires health care providers, including hospitals, hospices, and nursing homes to provide information about advance directives to admitted patients.</li>
                <li>The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (2003) began providing reimbursements for end-of-life care discussions with terminally ill patients.</li>
            </ol>
              
              <li>In April 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Blumenauer">Rep. Earl Blumenauer</a> (D-OR) proposed a bill that would provide reimbursement every five years for office visit discussions with Medicare patients on advance directives, living wills, and other end-of-life care issues. It had three Republican cosponsors: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boustany">Charles Boustany (R-LA)</a>, a cardiovascular surgeon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tiberi">Patrick Tiberi (R-OH)</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Davis">Geoff Davis (R-KY)</a>.</li>
              <li>The counseling was to be voluntary and could be reimbursed more often if a grave illness occurred. The legislation had been encouraged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundersen_Health_System#Medical_operations">Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center</a> and a loose coalition of other hospitals in La Crosse, Wisconsin that had had positive experiences with the widespread use of advance directives.</li>
              <li>Blumenauer's standalone bill was tabled and inserted into the large health care reform bill, HR 3200 as Section 1233 shortly afterward.</li>
              <li>Supporters of the Section 1233 counseling provision included the American Medical Association (AMA), AARP, the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, and Consumers Union. But the National Right to Life Committee opposed "the provision as written." See: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ap-fact-check-no-death-panel-in-bill/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ap-fact-check-no-death-panel-in-bill/</a></li>
              <li><b>It was removed from the Senate version of the bill due to the death panel controversy and was not included in the reconciled and final bill which became law in March 2010 and which is known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare).</b></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>RepubliCare May Force Retirees Out of Nursing Homes</h4>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Medicaid pays for most of the 1.4 million people in nursing homes. 
              It covers 20 percent of all Americans and 40 percent of poor adults. 
              See: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/science/medicaid-cutbacks-elderly-nursing-homes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/science/medicaid-cutbacks-elderly-nursing-homes.html</a>
            </li>
              <li>By 2026, spending on Medicaid will be slashed $772 billion. Page 5: <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849</a>
              </li>
              
               <li>Revenue would be reduced about $750 billion, mostly via tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy. Tables 2 and 3: <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849</a></li>
              <li>Caps on Medicaid spending will likely cause some states to reduce already low reimbursement rates for doctors. If this happens, "fewer providers might be willing to accept Medicaid patients.... If states reduced payments to Medicaid's managed care plans, some plans might shrink their provider networks, curtail quality assurance, or drop out of the managed care program altogether." Page 30: <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p><i>
              RepubliCare will not reduce the cost. It will simply cut services for the elderly and poor. 
                    And who will suffer the most when they ration care? 
                    The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. 
                    The America I know and love is not one in which the elderly or those with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of McConnell's "death panel" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their "level of productivity in society," whether they are worthy of health care. 
                    Such a system is downright evil.

              The Fabricated Controversy:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Former lieutenant governor of New York, Betsy McCaughey, claimed that Obamacare would enable "a vicious assault on elderly people" because it would "absolutely require" Medicare patients to have counseling sessions every five years that would "tell them how to end their life sooner". See: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/lt-gov-betsy-mccaughey-leads-death-panel-charge-writing-talking-points-article-1.395400</li>
                <li>Conservative talk radio hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham repeated McCaughey's claim.</li>
                <li>The AARP responded that the sessions were in no way designed to encourage euthanasia, but would instead help seniors make better decisions and would help ensure that their wishes were followed. See: https://community.aarp.org/t5/Politics-Current-Events/Health-Care-Reform-The-Assault-on-Truth-from-AARP-Bulletin-Today/td-p/1098457</li>
                <li>PolitiFact said the proposal provided Medicare coverage for optional counseling sessions for patients who wanted to learn more about end-of-life-planning. See: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/betsy-mccaughey/mccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi/</li>
                <li>Betsy McCaughey then published an Op-Ed in the New York Post, titled "Deadly Doctors", and asserted that presidential advisor Ezekiel Emanuel believed (by quoting him out of context) the disabled should not be entitled to medical care. See: http://nypost.com/2009/07/24/deadly-doctors/</li>
                <li>Excerpts from the McCaughey's op-ed were read, with approval, by Michele Bachmann on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health/policy/25zeke.html</li>
                <li>John Boehner and Rep. Thaddeus McCotter also repeated claims that Section 1233 would encourage "government-sponsored" euthanasia. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/us/politics/26death.html</li>
                <li>Rep. Virginia Foxx charged that the proposal would "put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government." See: http://newsok.com/democrats-take-sterner-line-against-health-care-misinformation/article/feed/66100</li>
                <li>Newt Gingrich also declared that the House bill had "a bias toward euthanasia". See: http://views.washingtonpost.com/healthcarerx/panelists/2009/07/right-gingrich.html</li>
                <li>The Washington Post reported on August 1, 2009 that the claim had been spreading via "religious e-mail lists" and internet blogs.</li>
                <li>In early August, members of Congress held town hall meetings that were marked by hostility—including shouting, sporadic, physical altercations and comparisons between the proposed reforms and Nazi Germany. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/politics/08townhall.html</li> 
                <li>Sarah Palin was the first to use the "death panel" term on August 7, 2009. She said: 
                  <ul><li><p><i>
                    Government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. 
                    And who will suffer the most when they ration care? 
                    The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. 
                    The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's "death panel" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their "level of productivity in society," whether they are worthy of health care. 
                    Such a system is downright evil.</i></p></li></ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            
            <h4>Now for some facts:</h4>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Legislation providing for counseling patients on advance directives, living wills and end-of-life care had been on the books for years. However, the laws did not provide for physicians to be reimbursed for giving such counseling during routine physical exams of the elderly.</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The Patient Self-Determination Act (1991) requires health care providers, including hospitals, hospices and nursing homes to provide information about advance directives to admitted patients.</li>
                <li>The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act began providing reimbursements for end-of-life care discussions with terminally ill patients in 2003.</li>
            </ol>
              
              <li>A bill to provide for reimbursement every five years for office visit discussions with Medicare patients on advance directives, living wills, and other end of life care issues was proposed by Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) in April 2009—with Republican cosponsors Charles Boustany (R-LA), a cardiovascular surgeon, Patrick Tiberi (R-OH), and Geoff Davis (R-KY).</li>
              <li>The counseling was to be voluntary and could be reimbursed more often if a grave illness occurred. The legislation had been encouraged by Gundersen Lutheran and a loose coalition of other hospitals in La Crosse, Wisconsin that had had positive experiences with the widespread use of advance directives.</li>
              <li>Blumenauer's standalone bill was tabled and inserted into the large health care reform bill, HR 3200 as Section 1233 shortly afterward.</li>
              <li>Supporters of the Section 1233 counseling provision included the American Medical Association (AMA), AARP, the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, and Consumers Union; the National Right to Life Committee opposed "the provision as written."</li>
              <li>It was removed from the Senate version of the bill due to the death panel controversy and was not included in the reconciled and final bill which became law in March 2010 and which is known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</li>
            </ul>

              Democrats compromised over a lie. We were promised Death Panels.

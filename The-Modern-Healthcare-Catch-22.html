            <p>
              Here's a "Catch 22" that might help illustrate one of many reasons for an available-for-all healthcare system.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born with a bad ureter on my right side. It's the tube that connects the bladder with the kidney and 
              it couldn't pass urine onto the bladder as it should. If 
              I were born just a 100 years ago, I would have eventually died from some kind of kidney complication. 
              Luckily, my mother was 
              a full-time employee and had insurance provided as a benefit by her employer. 
              And so the surgeon fixed the ureter and I 
              no longer suffer any more pain from it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The Catch 22 (ie. you're screwed if you do, screwed if you don't) is that I didn't choose to have a faulty 
               ureter. But I also didn't choose to be born in a country with outrageously expensive health care. Without 
               insurance, the surgery, doctor visits, pain medication, etc would have bankrupted my single-parent househould. 
               You either suffer the health consequences or the economic consequences&mdash;your choice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Being born during modern times means that you inherited a risky life and an expensive society.
              Insurance can prevent this Catch 22. If these scenarios are universally and automatically 
              covered at birth by insurance, 
              then the community has finally learned to protect its economic interests from our 
              inherently flawed human condition.
